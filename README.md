Just a simple mortgage table calculator.  Nothing fancy.  Takes some inputs from the command line & spits out mortgage calcs.  Built because I can.

Also using this repo to goof around with a few tools (Travis, Code Climate, etc) - don't expect this repo to continue working as I may break it every once in a while just for fun.
